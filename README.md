climatechangedeniers
====================

Repository of elected and appointed officials' positions on climate change.

You can submit new information through a pull request or a Google Form.

For now, the repository uses Bioguide ID as a unique identifier. Hopefully we can expand to include Open Civic Data IDs.

This repository wouldn't be possible without the [@unitedstates project](http://www.theunitedstates.io)'s [congress-legislator](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators) repo.
